# Snake

This repository features code for a game a game of Snake. The player must use the arrow keys to navigate a "snake" around the grid to collect the numbered targets without going out of bounds or hitting obstacles or itself. With each target collected, the snake grows longer, making it more difficult to navigate. There are four grids that the player can choose from with varying shapes and sizes. The code in this repository was built using Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and Tailwind.

To play the game, download the build folder and run the command `npm run start`.

Here is a sample screenshot of a game:
